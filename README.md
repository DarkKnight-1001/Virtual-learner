## **Introduction to Zeros and Poles of an Impedance Function :**

In electrical engineering, the *impedance function* represents how a circuit resists the flow of alternating current (AC) as a function of frequency. The **zeros** of the impedance function are the frequencies at which the impedance becomes zero (short circuit), while the **poles** are the frequencies where the impedance becomes infinite (open circuit). Analyzing the location of zeros and poles in the complex frequency domain helps in understanding the frequency response, stability, and resonance behavior of electrical networks.

**Experiment on Zeros and Poles of an Impedance Function (Short Description):**

This experiment aims to study the **frequency response** of an electrical network and identify the **zeros and poles** of its **impedance function**. By applying an AC signal over a range of frequencies and measuring the corresponding impedance, we can observe how the circuit behaves at different points. The frequencies where the impedance drops to zero indicate **zeros**, and where it spikes toward infinity indicate **poles**. This helps in analyzing and designing circuits for desired frequency characteristics.
