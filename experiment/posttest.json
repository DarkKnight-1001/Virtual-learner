      "question": "In an LC network, how are poles and zeros typically arranged on the s-plane?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Randomly distributed",
        "b": "All in the right-half plane",
        "c": "Interlaced on the imaginary axis",
        "d": "Located at the origin"

      "explanations": {
     
        "c": "In LC networks, poles and zeros are purely imaginary and interlace, ensuring oscillatory but stable behavior."

      "question": "Which statement about pole-zero cancellation is correct?",
      "answers": {
        "a": " It always simplifies analysis without consequence",
        "b": "It can hide unstable system modes",
        "c": "It is always a desired condition in control systems",
        "d": "It removes zeros from the frequency response"
      },
      "explanations": {
        
        "b": "Pole-zero cancellation may eliminate unstable modes mathematically, but not physically â€” they may still affect system behavior."
